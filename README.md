# Alex Rodriguez: 689 home runs and counting #

### A data visualiztion project using Angular, D3 and express. ###

Alex Rodriguez is one of the most controversial figures in professional sports, but he is also one of baseball's most prolific home run hitters. This application displays all of his career home runs using AngularJS as well as how his trajectory has compared to other members of the 600 Home Run Club using D3.

It was based on <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/kZzo8PgK6nfXr-xJmy4PYlp7FB-2YDNXZ3lJSCbd5A2Md6Tc4RzC0S*F-VBHhtA-uldvl5g705Hxp-huu67ERnqJ*hNfrPI1/0621arodgraphic.jpg" target="blank">this print graphic</a> I designed last year after Rodriguez recorded his 3,000th hit.
